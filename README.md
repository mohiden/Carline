# Microservice Car Auction Project

Welcome to the Microservice Car Auction project! This repository contains the source code for a car auction platform built using various technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core:** The backend services are developed using .NET Core, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the microservices.

- **Next.js:** The frontend of the application is built with Next.js, a React framework, enabling fast and efficient client-side rendering.

- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database used to store structured data related to the car auction platform.

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for handling unstructured data efficiently, employed for specific data storage needs within the project.

- **Docker:** Containerization technology used to package the application and its dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.

- **Kubernetes (K8s):** Container orchestration platform used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- **RabbitMQ:** Message broker used for enabling communication between microservices, ensuring reliable and asynchronous message processing.

- **SignalR:** Real-time communication library for enabling bid updates, notifications, and live interactions within the car auction platform.
